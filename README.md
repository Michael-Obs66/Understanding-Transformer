# Understanding-Transformer
Transformer-based deep learning models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms to process data in parallel
